# DataProcessingAlgorithm
Denoising Data Processing Algorithm implemented in Python

The code is now under reorganization to (1) solve fragment problem because of frequent parameter adjustment and rebuild during the prototype programming; (2) create interface and simple UI to make it easy to use. 

The whole algorithm will be wrapped up adopting the OOP paradigm for cleaness, clearity and future embedness/update/modifications. We also have plan to make a corresponding manual. The code is coming soon and the whole package is on the way.
